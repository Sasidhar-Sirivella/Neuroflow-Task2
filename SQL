#1. How many users completed an exercise in their first month per monthly cohort?
#Assumptions made for question1:
#a)Percentage calculated based on total number of users.
#b)And user_id as primary key so each user is allotted to only one task.


#QUERY1:(ORACLE DB)

select extract(year from created_at) as yr, extract(month from created_at) as mon,(count(user_id)*100/(select count(*) from users )) as percent_of_users
from users natural join exercises
where to_date(exercise_completed_date)-to_date(created_at)<31
group by extract(year from created_at), extract(month from created_at) 
order by yr, mon;


#2.Here I understood the question in two ways, hence I wrote two queries

#QUERY2:Query to Find the top five organizations that have the highest average phq9
score per patient. (MY SQL DB)

SELECT  organization_name FROM
(
 select patient_id,provider_id
from  PHq9 
group by patient_id,provider_id 
)res1 natural join(
 select patient_id
from  PHq9 
group by patient_id
order by avg(score) desc
)res2  natural join providers
LIMIT 5;


#Query to find the organizations that have the most severe patient population?
# when the following Assumptions are made:
a)Considered only severe patients.
b)provider_id and patient_id are unique.

SELECT * FROM
(
 select organization_name 
from  PHq9 natural join providers
where score>=20
order by score desc
) resultSet
LIMIT 5;
